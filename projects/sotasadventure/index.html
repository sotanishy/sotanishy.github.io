        <p>Sota's Adventure is a simple side-scrolling RPG game, just like Super Mario Bros.</p>

        <p>This is one of the biggest and most time-consuming project I have worked on, taking me some 5 months from writing the first line of code to publishing it on GitHub. Although there were some frustrating moments along the way, this is one of my favorite projects.</p>

        <p>This game is developed in Java, without any external library or framework (at that time I thought using someone else's code was cheating). Taking advantage of 3rd party code would have allowed me to finish the project much quicker, but I gained a lot from this experience and it surely made me a better coder.</p>

        <p>Oh, by the way, the icon for this website (and pretty much everything I use) came from this game.</p>

        <p>Download the game or view the source code on <a href="https://github.com/sotanishy/sotasadventure">GitHub</a>.</p>
